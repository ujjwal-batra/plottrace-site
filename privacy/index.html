  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="muted">Last updated: 24 Aug 2025</p>

  <p>PlotTrace (“we”, “our”, “us”) provides a reading companion app that lets you upload and analyze books to generate summaries and insights. This policy explains what personal information we collect, how we use it, and the choices you have.</p>

  <h2>Information we collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Account data:</strong> name, email address, authentication identifiers (e.g., Google Sign-In).</li>
    <li><strong>Content you upload:</strong> book files you choose to upload (e.g., PDF/EPUB/TXT) and metadata we derive (chapter splits, summaries, notes).</li>
    <li><strong>Usage & device data:</strong> app interactions, pages/screens viewed, approximate install source, device model, OS version, and diagnostic data (crash logs, performance events).</li>
    <li><strong>Support messages:</strong> messages you send to our support channels.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How we use information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide core features (store your library, generate summaries, sync progress).</li>
    <li>Authenticate users and secure the service.</li>
    <li>Monitor performance, fix crashes, and improve features.</li>
    <li>Communicate about updates, security notices, and important changes.</li>
    <li>Comply with legal obligations and enforce our Terms.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Processing & storage</h2>
  <p>We process your uploads to generate summaries and other features. Files and derived data may be stored on cloud infrastructure (e.g., object storage). We retain data for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide the service. You can request deletion at any time (see “Your rights”).</p>

  <h2>Third-party services</h2>
  <p>We may use trusted service providers to operate our app, for example:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> Google Sign-In.</li>
    <li><strong>Crash reporting & analytics:</strong> Firebase Crashlytics/Analytics (or equivalent).</li>
    <li><strong>Cloud hosting & storage:</strong> [e.g., AWS S3/Render/GCP] for backend APIs and file storage.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These providers process data on our behalf under contracts that protect your information.</p>

  <h2>Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not sell personal information. We share data only with: (i) service providers described above; (ii) if required by law; or (iii) with your consent.</p>

  <h2>Children’s privacy</h2>
  <p>PlotTrace is not directed to children under 13 (or the age required by your country). We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you believe a child has provided personal data, contact us to delete it.</p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>We use technical and organizational measures appropriate to the risk (encryption in transit, access controls, monitoring). No method is 100% secure; please keep your account credentials safe.</p>

  <h2>Your rights & choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Access, correct, or delete your data.</li>
    <li>Download your data (on request).</li>
    <li>Opt out of non-essential analytics where available in settings.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>To make a request, email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@plottrace.com">privacy@plottrace.com</a>. We’ll verify your identity and respond within a reasonable time.</p>

  <h2>International transfers</h2>
  <p>Your information may be processed and stored in countries different from your own. We take steps to ensure appropriate safeguards are in place.</p>

  <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy to reflect changes to our practices or legal requirements. We will post the updated version here with a new “Last updated” date.</p>
